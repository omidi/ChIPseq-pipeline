The changes I made in this pipe-line compared to the web-server installation:

TODO: 
      - WMQuality motevo
      - GetPeakPosts motevo
      - SiteEnrichment algorithm
      - RunMotevo reduction
      - Clean Up the components

NOTE: Wherever I run MotEvo (i.e. in all WMQuality, GetPeakPosts, SiteEnrichment and RunMotevo) I need to check which parameters I use (markovorder, bg_prior, ATCG frequencies ...) and eventually implement these parameters as arguments.

DONE:
WMQuality:  (WMQuality_updated.py)
           - now script is fitting priors on pooled training and shuffled training sets. Then it predicts sites on testing and shuffled testing set. 
           - It should run without alignments, for running with alignments it wasnt tested yet.
           - It's using uniform background base frequencies 
           - Needs testing (with and without alignments).


RunMotevo:  (RunMotevo_updated.py)
           - The precision - recall analysis is removed. Now it's only doing Wm refinement.
           - Needs testing for running it with and without alignments.


GetPeakPosteriors: (GetPeakPosteriors_updated.py and runmotevo_updated.py)
           - Adapted site predictions, i.e. prior is fitted on pooled training set and bg training set.
           - site predictions run onlz with sequences, not alignments.
           - should work now. Gets activated by using the right component.xml file.
