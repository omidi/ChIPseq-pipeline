interesting plot:

            -scatter of posteriors vs quality (RMSD)
            -scatter posterior vs height (maybe most interesting, since it shows whether chip seq signal (binding specificity, binding strength) correlates with WM score/ posterior (says something about the independent model of the PSWM etc). But posterior of what? TFBS can be right at the center of the peak or a little bit shifted. So take shift into account, somehow.
            -scatter sigma vs posterior


try:
        -When I give refined peaks from Selectpeaks to GetTrueRegions, the distance between TFBS and center of peaks can not be wider than 2*sigma of the refined peak. Thus the scatter will not have a width more than about 200bp.
              --I could give the sequence of the whole regions (from peakmerger), predict sites there and calculate distance to the nearest peak.
              --another idea (erik's suggestion): make histogram of the coverage at TFBS (or something like that). Or scatter of TFBS-peakcenter distance and coverage at TFBS (this is similar to scatter of posterior and height) 


output:
        -say which of the peaks (selected peaks from MM) are true, e.g. by saying that the posterior of all TFBSs under the peak must be over 0.9 or so (maybe 0.5)... This is better than giving out the sequences (of merged regions). This is not that informative.

        -for the plots:
             --write datapoints to a file: again bed like format one line for each TFBS or one line for each peak?
                                           1. chr, start, end, ID, strand, height, peak rmsd, summed posteriors
                                           2. distances somehow? one line for each TFBS: chr, start, end, peakID, distance, posteriors, distance weighted posterior.



TODO:
-do not loop over regcov dir to do all the statistics in plotTFBScov.. function. Loop over the regions in the input, then check whether there is a regcov file to plot it. I just use this regcov file for plotting (as far as I noticed). This way I can give a lot input sequences and get more statistics without having to compute regioncoverage for all. BUT NO: i would still have to run selectpeaksMM to get all statistics which also uses regioncoverage files and takes even longer anyway (I guess, maybe also not). Check whether it is really necessery to run SelectPeaksMM!
